# My-Calendar-Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

# Description
Module 5 Challenge from UTA Coding Bootcamp. The challenge is adding time blocks without changing the CSS code. When opening the site the date will display at the top of the planner. The column displays between two different colors. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 

# Usage
You can add important events to your busy schedule and save it to manage your time effectively. The text is saved in the local storage so that you can not lose it when refreshing the page.
